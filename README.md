# Learning Forensics w/notetaking

This will be one of more notebooks that will be using VSCode along with Obsidian to track my learning journey into topics of interest.
My notes will be taken in Obdisian and will include drawings using the ecalidraw community plug-in. They will also have an Anki style flashcard 
plug-in for spaced repitition learning.

## Overview 
My point is not to create beautiful and complex looking notes to impress anyone. I wish to makes notes as simple as possible to examine my learning. 
There is no need and sensible argument that can be made to me about why notes should be one way or another but practicality and speed are key. I 
believe there is no limit to a person' learning ability only a limit on their teachability and patience. Learning is a community endeavor. I enjoy the view
that Dr. Alfred Adler took on the problems of the world and that they all came to the issue of interpersonal relationship problems. We cannot comprehend 
the world if the universe what just one individual. This project is not about me, is what I am gettng at. I hope this serves another curious person
and helps them build a resource of learning for themselves.
