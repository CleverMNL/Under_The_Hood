## Overview 
My point is not to create beautiful and complex looking notes to impress anyone. I wish to makes notes as simple as possible to examine my learning. Notes should be focued on practicality and comprehension. I believe there is no limit to a person' learning ability only a limit to someones teaching ability and patience. 

Learning is a community endeavor. I enjoy the view that Dr. Alfred Adler took on the problems of the world and that they all came to the issue of interpersonal relationship problems. We cannot comprehend the world if the universe was just one individual. What I am mean to say is that this project is not about me. I hope this serves another curious person
and helps them build a resource of learning for themselves.
