# Under the Hood w/notetaking

This will be one of more notebooks that will be using VSCode along with Obsidian to track my learning journey into topics of interest.

## Overview 
My point is not to create beautiful and complex looking notes to impress anyone. I wish to makes notes as simple as possible to examine my learning. Notes should be focused on practicality and comprehension. I believe there is no limit to a person' learning ability only a limit to someones teaching ability and patience. I quote Richard Feynman who stated, "What I cannot crate, I do not understand.". Another great quote I believe to be relevant to any endeavor written by Andre Gide, "One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a long time.". Lastly, a quote by Epictetus, "If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.".

        Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tongue. - Proverbs 17:28

I would despise a life of a sophomore; more so than death.

Learning is a community endeavor. I enjoy the view that Dr. Alfred Adler took on the problems of the world and that they all came to the issue of interpersonal relationship problems. We cannot comprehend the world if the universe was just one individual. What I am mean to say is that this project is not about me. I hope this serves another curious person
and helps them build a resource of learning for themselves.

## Setup
I would recommend installing Obsidian (note-taking application) for its ease of use and because that is what I mainly used to take these notes.
I would also recommend using the "Excalidraw" community plug-in for Obsidian, the "Editing Toolbar" community plug-in, and the "Tracker" plug-in. 

## Mission
I can point to many great quotes about learning but ultimately, to learn and be curious is not something simply stated. I hope to find a strong reason to bring more people to curiosity and excellence throughout the duration of this project. 

NOTE:
One thing to note is that to try to learn by reading is not the most effective way to learn, at least 99% of people anyway. To show my learning process and how I have personally developed my skills, everything must be put into action. I must "get my hands dirty" by working on the things I am interested in, and the things I must do. A great way to learn is to teach, I only echo this long professed wisdom. Act with the best interest of others and do good (Hacking back in the day was very different from what it is now and a perpetrator will not be treated as they once were at the nascent stage of the internet). I do use a lot of book to aid my learning but alongside that I ask questions and talk with the content -perhaps this is more of my own mind, but I allow myself many daydreams while I am reading where I directly speak with the "book"- by asking questions in your mind or out loud as in an interview. As an example of using books as learning tools in this repository, the country designs html file used multiple books to cover lessons about things like: using svg in css and html; designs; styles; typography; layout; and effective design drafting on white paper. Not all work is done on paper but it can make designing a page faster which would lead to more learning from revisions.

## License 
I am going to be learning more about the specifics behind licensing and how they have powered the open source community to become what it has. In doing so, I wish to contribute to a communal learning. This repo is testing the usage of the GNU General Public License v3.0.
