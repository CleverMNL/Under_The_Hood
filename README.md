# Under the Hood w/notetaking

This will be one of more notebooks that will be using VSCode along with Obsidian to track my learning journey into topics of interest.
My notes will be taken in Obdisian and will include drawings using the excalidraw community plug-in.

## Overview 
My point is not to create beautiful and complex looking notes to impress anyone. I wish to makes notes as simple as possible to examine my learning. Notes should be focused on practicality and comprehension. I believe there is no limit to a person' learning ability only a limit to someones teaching ability and patience. 

Learning is a community endeavor. I enjoy the view that Dr. Alfred Adler took on the problems of the world and that they all came to the issue of interpersonal relationship problems. We cannot comprehend the world if the universe was just one individual. What I am mean to say is that this project is not about me. I hope this serves another curious person
and helps them build a resource of learning for themselves.

## Setup
I would recommend installing Obsidian (note-taking application) for its ease of use and because that is what I mainly used to take these notes.
I would also recommend using the Excalidraw community plug-in for Obsidian, the Editing Toolbar community plug-in, and the Tracker plug-in. 

## Mission
I can point to many great quotes about learning but ultimately, to learn and be curious is not something simply stated. I hope to find a strong reason to bring more people to curiosity and excellence throughout the duration of this project.

## License 
I am going to be learning more about the specifics behind licensing and how they have powered the open source community to become what it has. In doing so, I wish to contribute to a communal learning. This repo is testing the usage of the GNU General Public License v3.0.
