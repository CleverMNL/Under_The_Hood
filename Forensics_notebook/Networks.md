Examine Host, IP Addresses, and Networks

Hosts: any device which sends or received traffic (wth is traffic)

- Computer
- Laptop
- phones
- printers
- servers
- cloud servers
- IoT devices (that would include TV, speakers, light, Alexa, dishwasher if smart, refrigerator if smart)

they all follow the same rule for how to send and receive communications with the internet
  
Clients or server

Clients initiate requests, servers responds

A server can be a client if it initiates a request. It is relative to a specific communication method, File server example.

IP addresses are an identity of each host: (I want to add a comment here that I have watched and read about the cybersecurity sector for a while now and have taken notes before but this is something I want to pass long as a journal of my journey of sorts. I will do the same for other subject matters of interest such as finance and web development, forensics, etc. a motivation is the renaissance/enlightment eras. A more specific motivation to cybersecurity is the DefCon community and videos on Youtube.)
