Here are some great resources I have used to learn more about UI/UX and the application/importance of color theory.

This is a Canva document that reads like a research paper or passion project because it is in depth and well laid-out:
[100 color combination ideas and examples | Canva](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/)

This is a simple page that just works to give you a quick overview about color:
[60 Color Combinations and Palette Inspiration | Looka](https://looka.com/blog/color-combinations/)

This is Kevin Powell examining and explaining color theory in an understandable manner:

This is a great presentation, actually engaging and stimulating as the presenter had great experience in speaking:

It explains color codes used such as HSL, RGB, HEX, etc. A great resource that was introduced here was a contrast checker. Although I use a forced dark mode on my browser which dulls a lot of colors, it is still a great resource. 

Contrast Checkers:
