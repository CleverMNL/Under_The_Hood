Getting back to the basics and understanding the root/fundamentals that power the internet is the point of this note. Everything else is mainly built on top of this. 

Learning is fundamental to any progress. As such, the study of learning is crucial to progressing. I will simply state that I have done an non-exhaustive yet thorough amount of research in metacognition, pedagogy, and cognitive psychology. 

One model that has been overused and simplified yet works greatly at examining learning is an inverted triangle chart. I have broken down my learning abilities in this one: [[Learning Triangle]]

I guess I should then begin with electricity and how it works. I will link the resources I find most helpful to my learning process.

This video is well made with great visuals and explains things easily and visually. It introduces many concepts and give a high level overview. It is part of a playlist titled Electricity.

[Power Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSCEfJ4TXW4) Great video that is in depth and is high quality. 

[Simple explanation of a generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_ryxub-RA) This is a cool example of AC and DC but not the most explanative (also, those nails go crazy).

[Building a Generator - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb3iN4m9Bik) Clear and high quality visuals on making a generator using 3D views. Covers a lot of ground but does not go too in depth on them (for example, why do turn of a wire -the amount of times a wire is wrapped in a circle- so important to the output of energy created). This video made me think about things like energy loss, circuitry, scalability, consistency, and the health effects of EMF exposure and what EMF really is. Beautiful example of energy transfer using batteries too.

[Energy 101: Electricity Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Vb6hlLQSg) Simple overview of everyday things people take for granted. A bit of a black box video, meaning it does not cover all topic deeply but is great at connecting many items people use. (Does make me think about what is done with all the excess energy that is produces and transmitted in cables.)

[Introduction to Computing - Let's Make a Redstone Computer #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osFa7nwHHz4) This guy is a mad lad. Awesome video.

[VirtualBrain [ENG] - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@VirtualBrainENG/videos) This guy too.

**The most fascinating thing is that everyone and everything is built on the shoulders of others.**

I can elucidate using the example of steam used in power generation. The burning of fossil fuels or natural gas into steam which rotates turbines that generates kinetic energy and electricity which is then moved from one place to the next all would not be a thing if the power of steam was not used or captured. Hero was the first person to every use steam to create rotational motion in 130 BCE in Alexandria he called the "aelopile". If it were not for the works of Charles Parsons, an elite noble born tinkerer whose work only drew attention with the applications he derived from the works of Henri-Victor Regnault and William John Macquorn Rankine who would not have studied thermodynamics were it not for the applications taking a hold in the field of science in their times. These can lead to other people and things which points out the greatness of inventions. Regnault -by the way- documented his research in three volumes containing 3,200 pages.

A great analogy could be tied to using a phone book, the cliche in computer science. 

A simple breakdown of the process begins with a DNS or domain name system, this would be like the phonebook of all phonebooks. This ties two things together essentially, the human readable name of a website for example, and an IP address that uniquely identifies it. Our computer uses a browser which does everything for us and connects to DNS. The function of retrieving IP addresses done by the DNS then leads us to routing. This is a process of finding a location. Your search results in an IP your DNS returned when you searched for a server. Pages are held in servers so if you look for a website, you are looking in a server which then sends a response to your computer, ideally the website data (HTML, CSS, images, JS, etc.), but it can also send error messages. The final step to get a website to your computer for you to see is called browser rendering. This is a function that a browser does to interpret the data received from the server and display it (parse the HTML, CSS, JS, images).

The way data travels from one place to another is a different story that builds the infrastructure of the internet. This comes down to network protocols and routers. For the internet to function, measures are taken to ensure that data is reliable and efficiently handled to go from one place to another. Routers are devices that connect different networks. 

Most will refer to history and ARPANET but<font color="#92cddc"><strong> I want to say in a few words, what other take courses to learn. I also want to talk about under the hood things that will give depth to the words. </strong></font> I still do believe that history must be touched but perhaps I will just point to some useful resources here.
