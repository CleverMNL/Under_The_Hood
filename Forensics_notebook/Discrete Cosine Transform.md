[Discrete Cosine Transform Explained | Papers With Code](https://cs.paperswithcode.com/method/discrete-cosine-transform)

Use that website for more than just DCT, it is really useful.

This website tends to be less intense in their jargon and less academic so it is helpful to get a high-level understanding:

This is a very math oriented:
