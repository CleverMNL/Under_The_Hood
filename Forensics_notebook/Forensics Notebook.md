I will go over topics that include cryptography and some more specific topics within that topic as well as financial forensics.

Under the hood is a project that will also go into tangents such as how the copy and paste commands work, how electronics work, how compression works, and try to discover the why of all of these things.

Here I will link more specific files and this will act as a top level repo:
