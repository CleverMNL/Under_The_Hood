I will go over topics that include cryptography and some more specific topics within that topic as well as financial forensics. I want to learn more about mobile forensics and look into more specific topics such as message encryption, anonymized chats, etc.  I also want to look a web forensics. 

This all starts with understanding how the internet works and how devices allow for the transfer of information/data. Under the hood is a project that will also go into tangents such as how the copy and paste commands work, how electronics work, how compression works, and try to discover the why of all of these things.

I found these two videos to be helpful in designing my obsidian notes: 
1. [Markdown Embeds with Excalidraw Obsidian - MVP release (1.4.13) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsecSfnTMow)
2. [Obsidian Excalidraw Automation Showcase - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNksBPe75Ho)

Here I will link more specific files and this will act as a top level repo:

[[Programming]]

[[Web Development]]

[[Basics for finance forensics]]


A video I found that examined some high-level overview of the jargon of computers:
