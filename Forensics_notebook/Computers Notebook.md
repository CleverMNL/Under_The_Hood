I am fascinated by what computers can do and want to learn more about forensics so this is the under the hood notes projects of forensics.

This all starts with understanding how the internet works and how devices allow for the transfer of information/data. Under the hood is a project that will also go into tangents such as how the copy and paste commands work, how electronics work, how compression works, and try to discover the why of all of these things.

I found these two videos to be helpful in designing my obsidian notes: 
1. [Markdown Embeds with Excalidraw Obsidian - MVP release (1.4.13) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsecSfnTMow)
2. [Obsidian Excalidraw Automation Showcase - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNksBPe75Ho)

Here I will link more specific files and this will act as a top level repo:

 [[Networks]]

[[Programming]]

[[Web Development]]

[[Basics for finance forensics]]

A video I found that examined some high-level overview of the jargon of computers:
[CPP01_Chapter 1_Lecture (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gM_BM4NW80)

I will be using a few **roadmaps** to guide my notetaking, the following will be links to them:
