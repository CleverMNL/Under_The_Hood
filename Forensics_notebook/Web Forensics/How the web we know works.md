Getting back to the basics and understanding the root/fundamentals that power the internet is the point of this note. Everything else is mainly built on top of this. 

A great analogy could be tied to using a phone book, the cliche in computer science. 

A simple breakdown of the process begins with a DNS or domain name system, this would be like the phonebook of all phonebooks. This ties two things together essentially, the human readable name of a website for example, and an IP address that uniquely identifies it. Our computer uses a browser which does everything for us and connects to DNS. The function of retrieving IP addresses done by the DNS then leads us to routing. This is a process of finding a location. Your search results in an IP your DNS returned when you searched for a server. Pages are held in servers so if you look for a website, you are looking in a server which then sends a response to your computer, ideally the website data (HTML, CSS, images, JS, etc.), but it can also send error messages. The final step to get a website to your computer for you to see is called browser rendering. This is a function that a browser does to interpret the data received from the server and display it (parse the HTML, CSS, JS, images).

The way data travels from one place to another is a different story that builds the infrastructure of the internet. This comes down to network protocols and routers. For the internet to function, measures are taken to ensure that data is reliable and efficiently handled to go from one place to another. Routers are devices that connect different networks.
