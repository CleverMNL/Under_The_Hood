A quick but valuable lesson from Kevin Powell on designing a site:

Two front end course videos that cover a lot of the basics. I only use them here to refer to a resource as a beginner:

Kevin Powell has covered Figma and those are good videos to check out. Another aspect that is not thought about directly unless a person comes from an art background but impacts the entire design on a site is color theory. This explores the balance and coherence of color. It examines the complexity of how many colors there are and throws in hue, tint, and shadows too.
