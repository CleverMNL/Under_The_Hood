I feel like noting down html would be pointless for the most part, too much code exists out there already. I want to understand a bit more about how it functions or what allows it to function. 

I have some practice with html tags and have learned by building little pages as well as looking at public internet pages to see their html and some Css. One of the more entertaining projects I did to learn more about html was actually taken from a book called, "How to design and write web pages today" by Karl Stolley, and worked on learning about graceful degradation. Graceful degradation refers to the layout of a page in the most elegant manner possible with no styling, simply pure html. 

To get started I would point to an expert in the field: Kevin Powell. Here is a fundamental video for HTML.

Here is a great follow up to that:

There are some other resources such as books to tap into and read and one I would actually recommend and have read would be the aforementioned book by Karl Stolley because it takes a practical and theorical approach and synthesizes/mixes them well.
