I should begin this notebook with stating that I am passionate about finance and investing. This is a field I have spent many hours studying, I believe I have studied for approximately 1,300 hours. I may know a thing or two in this field and have learned that it is ever changing like many others and rigorously studied both academically and practically. I will make this point as well. I am not an expert, I have much to learn in this field and this is only my study material starting at a later step in the process. I know I know nothing. I only wrote the time I have spent studying this field as a disclosure to where I am at in learning about it, not as anything more. 

Accounting and Bookkeeping are the basis of all financial transactions. Ledger keeping and trial balances are used to learn from money moving from one place to another. I could begin with the reasoning of money and the history of currencies but that has been studied plenty and history is not my cup of tea. I will say I have studied it regardless because although history may seem boring, it has too many lessons for me not to at least look at it.
