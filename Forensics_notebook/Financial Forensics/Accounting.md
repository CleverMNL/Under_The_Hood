The PowerPoint slide here are helpful and highly recommended: [PowerPoints – Financial Accounting (lumenlearning.com)](https://content.one.lumenlearning.com/financialaccounting/chapter/powerpoints/)

I also used ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude to test my progress throughout the process of learning.
I will be redoing my notes here from Module 0 here but again, I have gone through the materials once before.

### Module 0: Why does accounting matters

The world runs on money. To keep track of it, move it, acquire it; we must understand it, implement tracking techniques, and use it. 

Many people use loans, including governments, companies, etc. We also have basic needs and these require money. We also have to pay taxes, and invest (because I believe investing is acting as stewards of money).  

It then talks about funding for your education and financial aid (I will skip this part for the sake of keeping content focused on finance). It also talks about making money while in college/university.
It also talks about the importance of personal finance which I agree about. One of the identifiers of wealth is how well money is managed and tracked by family. You should know how much is being spent and how much is being made, this is a central principle behind all accounting. 

DO make a family or personal budget sheet following the assignment presented in the module.

### Module 1: Role of accounting in business

The stakeholders of a company rely on the company functioning to get what they want/need from the company.

For example, it is in the best interest for people who rely, in some function, that Target still be in operation, that it keeps its finances is check. Target must track its finances to make sure they are able to stay open because it would go bankrupt otherwise. By learning about their expenses, they can figure out what prices to buy things at and what to sell them for. This could go into deeper economics but I will talk about that more here: [[Economics]]. 

Taking a sentence from their lectures : "All of this involves accounting, which is basically collecting, summarizing, and reporting on the often massive amount of data that represents the mission of every for-profit business: to make money." - Lumen Learning.

Module 1 Lesson 1- Defining Accounting + some history:

According to the AAA (American Accounting Association), accounting is: the process of identifying, measuring, and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decisions by the users of the information.

I personally find this answer complicated because any data analytics can fit the mold but that does not make it accounting. Even with the "economic information" distinction being made, it is an encompassing answer. It also includes necessary verbiage that would otherwise make the definition much longer. Process = a systematic way of doing something(s). Systematic = Something done in a step by step manner; refers to something being methodical. I also does not touch on how detailed and accurate it must be which I hold to a high regard, hence the study of accounting fraud exists. 

To get at the grassroots, accounting is a step by step approach of aligning financial transactions and non-financial transactions with financial consequences to the value of a business. This also covers a lot of ground and makes the point that accounting, much like everything else, is evolving and only dies/fails when it becomes mundane. 

Bookkeeping is - a weird word- the core behind all other financial processes. No financial statements can be made without it, no payroll, no income, etc. can be accurately made without it. 

The module writes about early monies and systems as well as how it was all tracked and noted. It highlights the impact of the second industrial revolution on accounting, pointing again to its evolving nature and adaptiveness. With strange collections, rates, distributed networks like never before, accounting had to develop as well. One note made by Lumen was: "the accounting profession continues to be at the forefront of innovation, from the use of artificial intelligence[,] to “big data”[,] to blockchain technology."

Module 1 Lecture 2 -Importance of Accounting: (The lecture numbers are not the most accurate to the Lumen Learning book contents)

In this lesson, there is an example business used to represent questions that anyone who manages some money should ask themselves like: "How much do I have?", "How much should I pay?", "How much is left over?", generally. 

Lecture 3 - Accounting Information: 
It is a wide subject that encompasses different reports, and information from various people/entities demanding it. The following covers those people/entities. 

Lecture 4 - People and entities:
Internal vs external users. This is simply a wide net used to distinguish two general users of accounting information. 

Internal users are people like managers and c-suites who use the data to make operating decisions and long term planning/strategy. For example, it is the manager who decides to lease a factory for 7 years based on the operating cost of buying vs renting one and how much they have available at the moment. 

External users are those who fall into one of 5/7 categories:
- Creditors/Lenders - These care because they make loans based on financial data
- Customers - These care because they want to know if prices are fair
- Investors - Is this a good investment?
- General Public - They should care to hold people responsible and make a healthy world where companies are not harming it.
- Unions/Employees/Vendors - Their livelihood and money depends on it.

There is also the Government which is interested in taxes.

Module 1 Lecture 5 Financial vs Managerial Accounting:
Same difference between internal vs external. Managerial primarily focuses on accounting for management/operating decision (do this or that). Financial primarily focuses on external but can be used by internal anyway, accounting for facts of the matter (financial statements, we have this much or that much). 

Each has its limits hence they both serve different purposes. Financial is purely backwards facing (it looks at historical facts) and therefore lacks timeliness and effectiveness in decision making for operations and it is in a fixed financial statement format which limits its application in forecasting. Some advantages are that they are verifiable, evidential, and they have a consistent format.

Some drawbacks of managerial accounting include inconsistent formats, especially from company to company. Not typically verified or audited (double checked). It does make it up for operations decisions because it is more adaptable and flexible and primarily uses close to real-time results that do not need to go through a lengthy audit process.

There is also entirely separate areas of accounting such as tax accounting and forensics accounting which I prefer over tax accounting. 

I choose to skip over taking notes on the next module on how the government uses accounting information made/prepared by others. 

Module 1 Lecture 7 Accounting Equation: 

A = L + OE      Stated in other words, assets should equal liabilities plus owners' equity. 

This always has to balance out and forms the basis of financial reporting for financial statements. 

Can also be stated as A - L or OE = L or OE 
                A - L = OE  /or/ A - OE = L

What are assets? - Something that a company owns or controls? which is expected to return a future benefit for the company. Pretty vague but people have made a list of all things which would count as an asset already so use that. 

I like this resource from the CFI (Corporate Finance Institute): [Types of Assets - List of Asset Classification on the Balance Sheet (corporatefinanceinstitute.com)](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/types-of-assets/)

This Indeed article was also informational: [52 Examples of Assets (With Methods for Evaluating Them) | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/examples-of-assets)

So then, what are liabilities? - things that dilute value of a company not including shareholders. Again, pretty broad.

What are shareholders and what is OE? - people who invest in the company equity including convertible assets. OE would include what they own, and money they receive from the company (think, dividends). 

OE would also include revenue and expenses. Revenue is what the company makes as income from running its business. A distinction is made between service and product income. <span style="font-weight:bold">Sales revenue</span> is used to account for a product revenue, and <span style="font-weight:bold">fees earned</span> is used to account for service revenue. Expenses are costs of doing business.

As an example, here are some business costs of doing business:
- Cost of (salaries and wages).
- Cost for (rent).
- Costs of (utilities).
- Cost of (supplies).
- Cost of (insurance which include theft and damages).
- Cost of (marketing).
- Costs related to (repairs and maintenance).

Module 1 Lecture 8 - Transactions and the Accounting Equation:
Accounting as a process of analyzing and identifying/classifying business transactions must track the following:
- Amount the business has
- amount it paid during the month
- amount it owes
- total costs to run the business
- and what its runway is (runway is a startup term for how much money they have to stay afloat/in business)

It is vital to keep these running totals up to date.

Tracking these running totals in an easy to understand manner or at least a more systemized way is what accounting also helps do. Those running totals/numbers will be called balances and each item will go into an account. Any item that is tracked in terms of running dollar balances is set up in an "account" name. Think of how Control + F helps simplify searching in a file, accounts makes items easier to find. When a manager asks, " how much x do we have left?", they can find that simply. 

This first step and the vital one to accounting is bookkeeping and it is the process of capturing data/recording transactions. An accounting transaction has a vague definition and can be anything that has a monetary impact on the financial statements of a business. 

Module 1 Lecture 10- Types of accounts
To help this process it is best to know what kind of business one is in. Is it a service, manufacturing, merchandising, retail, online-only, etc. Businesses will fall into the category of service, manufacturing, or merchandising but it is good to differentiate more (elucidate). 

One of the major tells that separates services from the rest is **inventory**. Nowadays, and more in the future, companies will be more evolved and as always, adaptation must occur. Ecosystems will arise where there may be no raw materials required mut things will still be "made". There can always be a mix of the big three (manuf, service, merch). 

Module Lecture 11- Types of financial statements
General purpose financial statements provide much of the information desired and required by external users. These are more formal reports that go under more careful study/revision. Financial statements used by externals are prepared using a system/protocol of accounting called Generally Accepted Accounting Principle, more commonly abbreviated to [[GAAP]]. 

4 basic and commonly used statements include the:
- Income statement
- Statement of Cashflow/Cashflow statement
- Balance sheet
- Statement of Owners Equity

The income statement is defined as a snapshot in time of revenues, expenses, and taxes which is based on a simple equation:

$$ Revenue - Expenses = Net Income (-net -loss -if -expenses > revenues) $$
This begins with stating the revenue on top and then taking from that (subtracting from it). This process is more of plug in the right number to the right expense category and assigning the proper revenue stream to the correct amount. 

The statement of owner's equity summarizes the changes in shareholder equity in a company. This means how much money the owners/investors get from the company or put into it. Imagine the stock market, this does not care for every single investor but summarizes this by stamping at a certain day/time how much something/someone owns (companies can own shares, so can trusts, and other organizations). This could include dividends and convertible investments. 

The statement of cashflows differs a bit but the main difference comes from if the accounting being done is based on cash or accrual basis: [[Cash vs Accrual]]. 

The balance sheet follow the accounting equation:

$$ Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity $$
This is therefore a derived work that can be made after the other statements are prepared. 

Module 1 Lecture 12- Challenges to accounting
#### Ethics 
that is the biggest. According to Lumen Learning, "...if the bank asks you for financial statements before it loans you money, no matter what, you have to provide accurate, verifiable, and honest information. That’s the ethical thing to do even if you think the bank’s loan committee might not like what they see."- but where would that go wrong? 

Module 1 Lecture 13- Ethics in accounting
The short and simple approach to this is that there are guidelines that address ethics and morals in accounting but I will say, these should be minimum standards and a person who strives for excellence and meaning should see to it that they go above and beyond the common practices that are complacent and not steward-like at all. The AICPA or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants along with the Institute of Management Accountant worked to develop the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct:  [AICPA Online Professional Library](https://pub.aicpa.org/codeofconduct/Ethics.aspx)

Why should ethics be brought up? Why else would I be learning about forensics if I did not care? It matters because it goes against that which is comes from weakness and exploits/hurts people. Those who are deemed honest or whose job requires their "honesty" should be doubly doubted and studied (think about priests and advisors, and broker/dealers to name a few, and I will throw in politicians-the lesser of the bunch). Never underestimate depravity or stupidity; actions that are harmful do not change repercussions due to any reason a perpetrator may have (although, this is not congruent with laws). 

Module 1 Lecture 14- 
Some events I will highlight that make accounting an evermore regulated area include the introduction of the SEC under FINRA, the establishment of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) as the governing body overseeing the accounting profession,  the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) -remember the code part because it does not have anything to do with enforcement but sets the laws-, the AICPA, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which along with the AICPA set standards for auditors called generally accepted accounting standards (GAAS), and many legal cases that made it known that people get hurt by those who are dishonest in money handling and transaction recording.

Module 2 Lecture 1- Enron and why accounting fails sometimes

Read up on Enron if unfamiliar. 

Module 2 Lecture 3- The Role of FASB
In 1973, the FASB took over the role of overseeing and setting accounting standards for public private and non-profit companies from the previous Accounting Principles Board and before them, the Committee on Accounting Procedures. **One thing to note is that the FASB is governed and funded by a private sector non-profit.** The Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF) is that company. FAF is in charge of overseeing, financing, administration, and member appointing for both the FASB and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The main reason for this private sector separation from politics (of course it is).

Module 2 Lecture 4-GAAP short version
The steps to develop and implement GAAP standards:
1. Identification = The FASB has a task force called the emerging issues task force that finds relevant issues/topics to discuss. 
2. Pre-agenda research = the technical staff conducts research
3. Agenda decision = the task force adds the topic to the agenda or decides to postpone it.
4. (not so) Public meeting = Meeting is held to debate the issue/topic.
5. Discussion Memorandum = a detailed paper is written and outlines solution proposals.
6. (insider) Stakeholder input = FASB collects responses/suggestions from the SEC, AICPA, public accounting firms, and other relevant parties.
7. Re-deliberation = re-discuss issues and solutions based on inputs received.
8. Exposure Draft is written = a preliminary version of a proposed change is issued/sent out that details the proposed solution.
9. Public responses = FASB obtains responses to the exposure and the exposure draft is revised as necessary. 
10. Final statement of Principle = if 4/7 FASB members which as assigned by the non-profit (FAF) support the revisions made to the Exposure draft, a statement of financial accounting standards is issued.
11. Education = It then becomes the job of the FASB to provide education to accountants (CPA's) on how to apply the new standard.
12. Implementation = FASB provides technical assistance in how to implement the revised standard.

One great example of how a proposed change actually was implemented and battled because of how it would impact business is used. In 1989, the FASB proposed that health and insurance costs be accounted for as employment expenses and not as retirement expenses as they had been which is not congruent with accrual accounting not the principle of matching. The business world was recognizing expenses for health and insurance after retirement and FASB proposed to make companies recognize expenses over the period of employment. During the Public meeting, companies expressed concern (pretty much cried) about the potential adverse effects to their current net incomes of reconciling past expenses; FASB reacted by changing their proposal and listening to the companies. All GAAP is compiles here: [Combine Sections - 105 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (fasb.org)](https://asc.fasb.org/105/showallinonepage)

More recently, the FAF established the Private Company Council (PCC) in order to address the restrictive nature and complexity of GAAP for smaller companies to follow which outweigh the benefit. These changes point to the nature of accounting again, and the adaptiveness required to understand it. 

Module 2 Lecture 5- Integral concepts to GAAP
Information should be made useful to many stakeholders in their decision making. It should also help asses the amounts, risk, and timing of cashflows in the business. Thirdly, it should identify the economic resources of a company. 

This importance of information leads to:
- The monetary unit assumption
- The historical price principle

Monetary unit assumption
