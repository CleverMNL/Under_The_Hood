The resource used by me is: [Financial Accounting – Simple Book Publishing (lumenlearning.com)](https://content.one.lumenlearning.com/financialaccounting/)

The PowerPoint slide here are helpful and highly recommended: [PowerPoints – Financial Accounting (lumenlearning.com)](https://content.one.lumenlearning.com/financialaccounting/chapter/powerpoints/)

I also used ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude to test my progress throughout the process of learning.
I will be redoing my notes here from Module 0 here but again, I have gone through the materials once before.

Going through the assignments is also very helpful: [Assignments – Financial Accounting (lumenlearning.com)](https://content.one.lumenlearning.com/financialaccounting/chapter/assignments/)

### Module 0: Why does accounting matters

The world runs on money. To keep track of it, move it, acquire it; we must understand it, implement tracking techniques, and use it. 

Many people use loans, including governments, companies, etc. We also have basic needs and these require money. We also have to pay taxes, and invest (because I believe investing is acting as stewards of money).  

It then talks about funding for your education and financial aid (I will skip this part for the sake of keeping content focused on finance). It also talks about making money while in college/university.
It also talks about the importance of personal finance which I agree about. One of the identifiers of wealth is how well money is managed and tracked by family. You should know how much is being spent and how much is being made, this is a central principle behind all accounting. 

DO make a family or personal budget sheet following the assignment presented in the module.

### Module 1: Role of accounting in business

The stakeholders of a company rely on the company functioning to get what they want/need from the company.

For example, it is in the best interest for people who rely, in some function, that Target still be in operation, that it keeps its finances is check. Target must track its finances to make sure they are able to stay open because it would go bankrupt otherwise. By learning about their expenses, they can figure out what prices to buy things at and what to sell them for. This could go into deeper economics but I will talk about that more here: [[Economics]]. 

Taking a sentence from their lectures : "All of this involves accounting, which is basically collecting, summarizing, and reporting on the often massive amount of data that represents the mission of every for-profit business: to make money." - Lumen Learning.

Module 1 Lesson 1- Defining Accounting + some history:

According to the AAA (American Accounting Association), accounting is: the process of identifying, measuring, and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decisions by the users of the information.

I personally find this answer complicated because any data analytics can fit the mold but that does not make it accounting. Even with the "economic information" distinction being made, it is an encompassing answer. It also includes necessary verbiage that would otherwise make the definition much longer. Process = a systematic way of doing something(s). Systematic = Something done in a step by step manner; refers to something being methodical. I also does not touch on how detailed and accurate it must be which I hold to a high regard, hence the study of accounting fraud exists. 

To get at the grassroots, accounting is a step by step approach of aligning financial transactions and non-financial transactions with financial consequences to the value of a business. This also covers a lot of ground and makes the point that accounting, much like everything else, is evolving and only dies/fails when it becomes mundane. 

Bookkeeping is - a weird word- the core behind all other financial processes. No financial statements can be made without it, no payroll, no income, etc. can be accurately made without it. 

The module writes about early monies and systems as well as how it was all tracked and noted. It highlights the impact of the second industrial revolution on accounting, pointing again to its evolving nature and adaptiveness. With strange collections, rates, distributed networks like never before, accounting had to develop as well. One note made by Lumen was: "the accounting profession continues to be at the forefront of innovation, from the use of artificial intelligence[,] to “big data”[,] to blockchain technology."

Module 1 Lecture 2 -Importance of Accounting: (The lecture numbers are not the most accurate to the Lumen Learning book contents)

In this lesson, there is an example business used to represent questions that anyone who manages some money should ask themselves like: "How much do I have?", "How much should I pay?", "How much is left over?", generally. 

Lecture 3 - Accounting Information: 
It is a wide subject that encompasses different reports, and information from various people/entities demanding it. The following covers those people/entities. 

Lecture 4 - People and entities:
Internal vs external users. This is simply a wide net used to distinguish two general users of accounting information. 

Internal users are people like managers and c-suites who use the data to make operating decisions and long term planning/strategy. For example, it is the manager who decides to lease a factory for 7 years based on the operating cost of buying vs renting one and how much they have available at the moment. 

External users are those who fall into one of 5/7 categories:
- Creditors/Lenders - These care because they make loans based on financial data
- Customers - These care because they want to know if prices are fair
- Investors - Is this a good investment?
- General Public - They should care to hold people responsible and make a healthy world where companies are not harming it.
- Unions/Employees/Vendors - Their livelihood and money depends on it.

There is also the Government which is interested in taxes.

Module 1 Lecture 5 Financial vs Managerial Accounting:
Same difference between internal vs external. Managerial primarily focuses on accounting for management/operating decision (do this or that). Financial primarily focuses on external but can be used by internal anyway, accounting for facts of the matter (financial statements, we have this much or that much). 

Each has its limits hence they both serve different purposes. Financial is purely backwards facing (it looks at historical facts) and therefore lacks timeliness and effectiveness in decision making for operations and it is in a fixed financial statement format which limits its application in forecasting. Some advantages are that they are verifiable, evidential, and they have a consistent format.

Some drawbacks of managerial accounting include inconsistent formats, especially from company to company. Not typically verified or audited (double checked). It does make it up for operations decisions because it is more adaptable and flexible and primarily uses close to real-time results that do not need to go through a lengthy audit process.

There is also entirely separate areas of accounting such as tax accounting and forensics accounting which I prefer over tax accounting. 

I choose to skip over taking notes on the next module on how the government uses accounting information made/prepared by others. 

Module 1 Lecture 7 Accounting Equation: 

A = L + OE      Stated in other words, assets should equal liabilities plus owners' equity. 

This always has to balance out and forms the basis of financial reporting for financial statements. 

Can also be stated as A - L or OE = L or OE 
                A - L = OE  /or/ A - OE = L

What are assets? - Something that a company owns or controls? which is expected to return a future benefit for the company. Pretty vague but people have made a list of all things which would count as an asset already so use that. 

I like this resource from the CFI (Corporate Finance Institute): [Types of Assets - List of Asset Classification on the Balance Sheet (corporatefinanceinstitute.com)](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/types-of-assets/)

This Indeed article was also informational: [52 Examples of Assets (With Methods for Evaluating Them) | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/examples-of-assets)

So then, what are liabilities? - things that dilute value of a company not including shareholders. Again, pretty broad.

What are shareholders and what is OE? - people who invest in the company equity including convertible assets. OE would include what they own, and money they receive from the company (think, dividends). 

OE would also include revenue and expenses. Revenue is what the company makes as income from running its business. A distinction is made between service and product income. <span style="font-weight:bold">Sales revenue</span> is used to account for a product revenue, and <span style="font-weight:bold">fees earned</span> is used to account for service revenue. Expenses are costs of doing business.

As an example, here are some business costs of doing business:
- Cost of (salaries and wages).
- Cost for (rent).
- Costs of (utilities).
- Cost of small items used to run a business (supplies).
- Cost of protection from liability, damage, injury, theft, etc. (insurance).
- Cost of promoting the business (advertising).
- Costs related to the upkeep of machinery and buildings (repairs and maintenance).

There are two predominant accounting guidelines or frameworks that are used most used. IFRS and GAAP, there are others, but they are less relevant. I will explore concepts of both and document which resources I have used to learn about accounting. 

[[GAAP]] - Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

[[IFRS]] - International Financial Reporting Standards
