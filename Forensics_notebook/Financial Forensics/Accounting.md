The resource used by me is: [Financial Accounting – Simple Book Publishing (lumenlearning.com)](https://content.one.lumenlearning.com/financialaccounting/)

I also used ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude to test my progress throughout the process of learning.
I will be redoing my notes here from Module 0 here but again, I have gone through the materials once before.

Going through the assignments is also very helpful: [Assignments – Financial Accounting (lumenlearning.com)](https://content.one.lumenlearning.com/financialaccounting/chapter/assignments/)

### Module 0: Why does accounting matters

The world runs on money. To keep track of it, move it, acquire it; we must understand it, implement tracking techniques, and use it. 

Many people use loans, including governments, companies, etc. We also have basic needs and these require money. We also have to pay taxes, and invest (because I believe investing is acting as stewards of money).  

It then talks about funding for your education and financial aid (I will skip this part for the sake of keeping content focused on finance). It also talks about making money while in college/university.
It also talks about the importance of personal finance which I agree about. One of the identifiers of wealth is how well money is managed and tracked by family. You should know how much is being spent and how much is being made, this is a central principle behind all accounting. 

DO make a family or personal budget sheet following the assignment presented in the module.

### Module 1: Role of accounting in business

The stakeholders of a company rely on the company functioning to get what they want/need from the company.

For example, it is in the best interest for people who rely, in some function, that Target still be in operation, that it keeps its finances is check. Target must track its finances to make sure they are able to stay open because it would go bankrupt otherwise.  By learning about their expenses, they can figure out what prices to buy things at and what to sell them for. This could go into deeper economics but I will talk about that more here: [[Economics]].

There are two predominant accounting guidelines or frameworks that are used most used. IFRS and GAAP, there are others, but they are less relevant. I will explore concepts of both and document which resources I have used to learn about accounting. 

[[GAAP]] - Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

[[IFRS]] - International Financial Reporting Standards
