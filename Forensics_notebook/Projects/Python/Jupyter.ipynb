    "Jupyter is a project that does so much it would be remiss to cover it lightly. It supports over 40 programming languages (for the longest time I thought it was built solely for python- how naive). It is a tool that helps streamline collaboration on projects and creates direct interactivity like no others. I will perhaps use it it my other project files but the only draw back is the length. It is more suited for projects with limited dependabilities and external file usage. Here is the official page: https://jupyter.org/ which covers why it is so amazing. I do not have to sing high praise for this project as it does not need any, it simply is. Some projects I have that exist outside of this Repository include transcriptions of book in cryprography and web security in Python. \n",
