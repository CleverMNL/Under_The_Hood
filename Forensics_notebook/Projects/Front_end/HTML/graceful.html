                Inspired by 
                <cite>
                    "How to design and write web pages today" by Karl Stolley.
                </cite>
            </h2>

            <p>I took it upon myself to learn how to properly structure HTML, later CSS and ECMAScript
                because I want to work on <em>under the hood</em> projects. I have been doing the same with C/C++ and Python
                in order to gain a deeper understanding of all things CS.
            </p>
            <h2>Motivations and lessons</h2>
            <p> 
                A motivation behind this project has not only been the book but also a deep desire to 
                build things. This outlet has been fun to work with and I see so much progress in it.
                This, alongside some projects I want to build for the basis for why I am passionate about
                practicing and gaining traction with my ability to program and create front-end projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could link other HTML pages I have been working on here but I have a dedicated
                project that does that. It lists other projects is all. A lesson behind gracegul 
                degradation is in making something purely in HTML be as pretty as possible. The main
                tenets of web pages are core to this: 
                <ul class="aus">
                    <li> Accesibility</li>
                    <li> Usabiliy</li>
                    <li> Sustainability</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="secondary">
            <h2>
                Structure matters
            </h2>

            <p>
                Making the structure not overly confusing and navigation simple. 
                This is a key factor to notice and get feedback on as often as you
                can from actual users. This is an aspect of usability.

                <h4>Five useful usability test questions: </h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Can users find everything there is to find fairly easily?</li>
                    <li>Can user find specific items if they were asked to?</li>
                    <li>What would a user look at on your site? 
                        "What would you look at to decide whether to buy from us?
                    </li>
                    <li>Can users find things they found before, easily? 
                        <strong>This is a matter of consistency as well.</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Another aspect of structure that should not be overlooked is simple navigation tools.
                This could be a nav bar or an in page search tool such as the one shown in the
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_searchbar.asp">How TO- Search Bar by W3Schools</a>.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="tertiary">
            <h2>
                 More Info
            </h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Accessibility</strong> requires designing for conditions. <strong>Usabiliy</strong> requires desgining for behaviors. 
                <strong>Sustainability</strong> requires designing for accessibility and usability in two dimensions: time and scale.

            If you want to follow my learning journey, embark on one together, or just see other things I am working on.
            Check out my <a href="F:/HTML_CSS_JS_LEARNING_PROJECTS/Portfolio_Cab_designs/index.html">Projects page</a>, if you 
            would are interested in my latest project check out <a href="F:/HTML_CSS_JS_LEARNING_PROJECTS/First_Bulma_project/index.html"> A Finance Post</a>. 
            I also work on things in Python, am currently in the process of learning C/C++ and ECMAScript as well as Ruby for fun.
            More specifically, I want to build screensavers using C and learn about more under the hood processes. With ECMAScript
            I aim to design better frontend and delve into cooler projects such as Node and Express ans use Typescript to build on 
            top of that. I want to learn Ruby because why not? The project roots intrigue me and have a good application on web developement.

        <p>
            The footer is new to me but I have seen it be used on other sites.
            They usually tag something or link something short.
